# Checksum-verified curl workflow

## Status

Version `0.1.0.dev5` introduces the release workflow candidate.  It is not a
supported production installation method until the immutable bundle and
bootstrap are published, their checksums are recorded, and the complete
install, adapter, removal, reinstall, and purge boundaries pass Raspberry Pi 3
acceptance.

## Trust chain

The documented command will never pipe a mutable branch directly into a shell.
It will:

1. download a small bootstrap from an immutable Git commit over HTTPS;
2. verify the bootstrap against the SHA-256 value printed in the repository;
3. run the verified bootstrap without elevated privileges;
4. download a versioned release bundle from a second immutable Git commit;
5. verify the complete bundle against the checksum embedded in the verified
   bootstrap;
6. validate the bundle's source-commit marker;
7. invoke `sudo` only for the selected, verified installation or removal phase.

The final public commands will be added here only after the immutable bootstrap
and bundle exist.  Until then, no branch-based curl command is supported.

## Supported actions

The one bootstrap exposes five distinct actions:

- `install` installs the unprivileged companion service and collection timer;
- `install-adapter` separately installs the Pi-hole Web v6.6 sidebar adapter;
- `remove-adapter` verifies and removes only the sidebar adapter;
- `uninstall` removes services, application files, and the service account but
  preserves all user data;
- `purge-data` is a separate destructive action requiring the exact
  confirmation `DELETE /var/lib/pihole-speedtest`.

## Dynamic device configuration

The installer does not contain a private network address.  It detects the
device's primary address at runtime for a typical HTTP Pi-hole installation.
Users with a hostname, HTTPS, reverse proxy, or nonstandard origin can provide
their own `--pihole-origin` and `--companion-url` values.

## Fail-closed checks

Installation refuses to continue unless all of the following are true:

- the release bundle checksum and source marker match;
- the architecture is `aarch64` or `x86_64`;
- Python 3.9 or newer is available;
- Pi-hole Core v6 is installed;
- the official Ookla CLI is installed at `/usr/bin/speedtest`;
- no conflicting active companion installation exists;
- preserved data comes from a verified uninstall or failed installation;
- any preserved SQLite database passes `PRAGMA integrity_check`;
- the selected collection interval is supported.

The optional adapter retains its stricter Pi-hole Web v6.6 layout and checksum
gates.

## Preservation and recovery

Default uninstall creates and verifies an online SQLite recovery copy before
removing services.  It retains `/var/lib/pihole-speedtest`, including history,
settings, backups, migration reports, manifests, and prior recovery evidence.
A later install reuses that directory and verifies the database before starting
services.  Installation and removal traps restore service files after a partial
failure without deleting user data.

The purge action is unavailable while any application, unit, environment file,
or service account remains.  It also refuses data without a verified uninstall
marker.

## Acceptance still required

- clean Raspberry Pi 3 ARM64 installation;
- separate sidebar installation and exact removal;
- interrupted-install rollback and repeat invocation;
- default uninstall with unchanged history and settings;
- reinstall using the preserved history;
- reboot with dashboard and timer continuity;
- explicit purge test using disposable data only.
